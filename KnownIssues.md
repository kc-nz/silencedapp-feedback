### Desktop Client
- Screenshare low FPS at source quality (investigating, might be the way livekit is proxied)
- Settings menu half of the items don't work LOL

### Web Client
- Settings menu half of the items don't work LOL


### Voice & Video
- Delay inbetween channel join and voice connection - likely CF Proxying the Livekit handshake chain, will look at undoing that.

### Messaging
- No E2EE on messages (DMs, Group Chats, etc)
